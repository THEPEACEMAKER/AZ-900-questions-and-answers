# AZ-900-questions-and-answers

This React project is a collection of practice questions for the AZ-900 Exam. It simplifies the process of searching for and studying exam-related concepts.

The questions included in this project are sourced from various internet searches and are not actual exam questions. They are designed to aid in personal exam preparation based on my own study experience.

The project serves as a tool to help you connect ideas and achieve the main goal of the exam, which is to understand the main AWS services and their appropriate use cases.

## Usage

To access and use the project, visit the [AZ-900-questions-and-answers](https://az-900-questions-and-answers.netlify.app/) website. There, you can browse the questions, search for specific topics, and reinforce your knowledge of AWS services. Please note that the provided questions are not official exam questions.

## Purpose

I created this project while studying for the exam myself, with the intention of sharing a resource that can assist others in their AZ-900 Exam preparation. The Repo [Practice Tests Exams Questions & Answers](https://github.com/Ditectrev/Microsoft-Azure-AZ-900-Microsoft-Azure-Fundamentals-Practice-Tests-Exams-Questions-Answers) is the source of most of the questions. I've just added the interactive element in this version.
